# secureyournode

Security workshop, with exercises in an attack/defense style format.

Attack exercises will teach you how to exploit vulnerabilities.
Defense exercises will teach you how to protect against then.

This workshop will be a mix of general web security (XSS, CSRF), and javascript-specific *gotchas* (with etc.)

**This is a work in progress, the code will be hacky and messy, so, fix it or don't complain!**
